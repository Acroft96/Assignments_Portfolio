Project Overview: Node/Express Website

Description
This project is designed to practice building a Node and Express website, which consists of several functionalities:
Data Input Page: 
An HTML form to collect user information (first name, last name, and favorite food). This page is served from the backend and submits data to a specified route, which then stores the information in a text file.
Data Display Page: 
A dynamic page that displays all stored user information. This page does not exist as a static HTML file but is generated by a route that reads the data from the text file and constructs an HTML string on the fly, adding table rows for each entry.
Search Page: 
An HTML form where users can input a favorite food and see a list of all people who have that favorite food. This page also exists on the backend and, upon submission, a route processes the input, reads the data file, and sends back a dynamically generated HTML string with the matching entries.

Technologies Used
Node.js: For the server-side runtime environment.
Express.js: To create the server and handle routing.
HTML/CSS: For creating the forms and basic page structure.
JavaScript: For backend logic and handling form submissions.
File System (fs) Module: To read from and write to a text file on the server.

Technical Challenges
One of the main challenges was dynamically generating HTML content on the server side. This required:
Reading from the Text File: 
Using the fs module to read the data file, ensuring that the read operations were handled asynchronously to avoid blocking the server.
Generating HTML Strings: 
Constructing an HTML string dynamically in the route, which included iterating over the file's content and building table rows for each entry. This needed careful handling to ensure correct HTML structure and data rendering.
Handling Form Submissions: 
Properly configuring routes to handle form submissions, extract data from the request, and write it to the text file without losing existing data.

My Contributions
For this project, I was responsible for:
Setting up the Express Server: 
Configuring the server and setting up routes to handle different functionalities (data input, data display, and search).
Creating HTML Forms: 
Designing the forms for data input and search, ensuring they were user-friendly and functional.
Implementing Backend Logic: 
Writing the logic to handle form submissions, read/write data to the text file, and dynamically generate HTML content.
Organizing Project Structure: 
Ensuring a clean and organized layout by separating routes and pages into distinct folders for better maintainability.
