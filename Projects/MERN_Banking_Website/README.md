Project Overview: Expanded Banking App

Description
This project involves expanding a previously implemented basic banking app into a more comprehensive application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The project is divided into two main parts: designing a clean and functional React frontend, and then implementing the backend functionalities. The app includes a robust login system, role-based access control, and comprehensive banking features.

Frontend Implementation
Login System:
Users log in with a username and password.
Verification of credentials is handled, and feedback is provided on success or failure.
User Roles:
Administrator:
Access to all screens.
Can manage roles (elevate/demote users).
Customer:
Assigned a bank customer ID number.
Can deposit/withdraw money into/from savings, checking, and investment accounts.
Can transfer money between their accounts.
View full and individual account transaction histories.
Employee:
Can view any customerâ€™s account, perform deposits/withdrawals, and transfer money between accounts.
Can transfer money to another customer's account with their ID.
Can create new accounts.
Clean UI

The frontend uses a consistent theme and CSS, likely utilizing Bootstrap for a polished look.
The design ensures proper alignment and justification of items, spacious textboxes, and an overall professional appearance.

Backend Implementation
User Management:
Registration: Create new accounts with hashed passwords (SHA-256) stored in the database.
Login: Verify credentials by hashing the input password and comparing it with the stored hash.
Role Management: Administrators can change user roles.
Banking Operations:
Deposit/Withdrawal: Users can deposit or withdraw money from their accounts.
Transfers: Users can transfer money between their accounts and employees can transfer money to other customers' accounts.
Transaction History: Display full and individual account transaction histories.
Security

Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before storage.
Sessions are managed securely, with session info stored in MongoDB.

RESTful API Routes
POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: Authenticate user and start a session.
POST /logout: End the user session.
POST /role: Update user roles.
POST /deposit: Deposit money into an account.
POST /withdraw: Withdraw money from an account.
POST /transfer: Transfer money between accounts.
GET /transactions: Retrieve transaction history.

Technologies Used
MongoDB: Database to store user and account information.
Express.js: Web framework for building the backend and handling routes.
React: Frontend library for building user interfaces and managing state.
Node.js: Server-side runtime environment.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB and Node.js.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for styling the frontend.
Express-Session: Middleware for managing user sessions.

Technical Challenges
Session Management:
Implementing secure and efficient session management using express-session and storing session data in MongoDB.
Password Hashing:
Hashing passwords using SHA-256 and securely storing them in the database.
Role-Based Access Control:
Implementing logic to handle different user roles and permissions.
UI Consistency:
Ensuring the frontend design is consistent, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
State Management in React:
Managing component state and props efficiently to reflect real-time changes in the user interface.
